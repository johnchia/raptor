# TLS, AND WHICH MBEDTLS THAT MEANS
#
# rss_tls.c is written against the 3.x API -- mbedtls_pk_parse_keyfile takes
# an RNG there and does not in 2.x -- so "is there an mbedtls" is the wrong
# question to gate on. An OpenIPC sysroot answers yes twice: Majestic pins
# the end-of-life 2.25 at the shared usr/include and usr/lib, and
# mbedtls3-openipc installs 3.6 under its own usr/mbedtls3 prefix precisely
# so the two can coexist. This used to find the 2.25 and set TLS=1 against
# its headers, and the build stopped at
#
#   rss_tls.c:109: error: too many arguments to function mbedtls_pk_parse_keyfile
#
# with rvd already cleaned and never relinked. Nothing was wrong with the
# sysroot; the detection was asking about the wrong library.
#
# So look for a 3.x tree, private prefix first, and build HTTP-only when
# there is none rather than starting a build that cannot finish. This is the
# same choice general/package/raptor-streaming/raptor-streaming.mk makes for
# the firmware image, by hand, with MBEDTLS3_OPENIPC_CFLAGS and _LIBS.

# Answers with the major version, or with nothing, and SUCCEEDS EITHER WAY.
# The `|| true` is load-bearing: sed exits 2 on a header that is not there,
# 2.x has no build_info.h at all, and under `set -e` a failing command
